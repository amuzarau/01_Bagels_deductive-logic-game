Bagels, a deductive logic game.  My educational project from Al Sweigart book “The Big Book of Small Python Projects”

You must guess a secret three-digit number based on clues. The game offers one of
the following clues in response to your guess:
“Pico”  - your guess has one correct digit in the wrong place, 
“Fermi” -  your guess has one correct digit in the correct place, 
“Bagels” -  your guess has no correct digits. 

For example, if the secret number was 248 and your guess was 843, the
clues would be Fermi Pico. 

You have 10 tries to guess the secret number.
